About @FXML

 - MainScreenNORMAL is the normal looking version of MainScreen.
 - MainScreen itself looks messed up. Not sure why.
 
 - Not sure if OrderScreen is the updated version from Use Case #1.
 - Need to update Search Function of Order Screen
 
 - EditInventory is in need of serious work, couldn't get around to nailing it down because it has several questionable design decisions such as:
	- Too much space on the screen.
	
 - SettingsScreen: Set a splitpane; As far as I understand, settings screen, when you click on an option on the left, it 'pop' ups a 'screen' on the right of the splitpane the options of that specific setting button.
